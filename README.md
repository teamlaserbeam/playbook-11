# Playbook

The Playbook holds all the rules we **must** follow when writing front-end code at AMARO.

## Quotes

> All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed. - _Rick Waldron_

> It is harder to read code than to write it. - _Joel Spolsky_

> Arguments over style are pointless. There should be a single style guide and you should follow it. - _Rebecca Murphey_

> Websites are systems rather than pages and as soon as we stop perceiving them as that, the better. - _Anna Debenham_
